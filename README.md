# This program is no longer used. For the Manuscript iOS version, I am using Core ML and the built-in Xcode tools to train models.

# Why a Java version and a Python version?

I plan to use Tensorflow to do the ML portion of this project. From my research in Tensorflow, it appears that the preferred way to do things is to create a model in Python, export it, and then load it up in the Java version for use in the Android app.

This is because Tensorflow is primarily developed in Python, and the Java version doesn't have all of the features that the Python version has.
